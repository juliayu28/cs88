  <h1>Welcome to CS 88!</h1>

  <h2>Week 13</h2>
  <h4>Key Takeaways:</h4> <p>This week, we learned about iterators and generators from Alec, our awesome tutor :)</h4><p>
  <p><a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zmhIhDtm_ARQT7dWA_S9w2JetOZyKRXvU6c4FqUpTXw/edit#slide=id.g5676307864_0_380" role="button">Alec's Slides</a><a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=182W8T1MzkhYRK8aFFndwSqYGLM3h-ypZ" role="button">Optional Worksheet/Guide</a></p>
  <h2>Week 12</h2>
  <h4>Key Takeaways:</h4> <p>This week's lab was extending OOP from last week's by going into more depth about classes and inheritance. Remember that inheritance is a powerful tool we can use to connect classes both conceptually and to reuse code. Some things to keep in mind about OOP: designing a class takes many conscious decisions, think carefully about what you want your class to do! Inheriting is not always the right answer. For example, in HW 9, class CheckingAccount inherited from Account because CheckingAccount is a type of Account but Check did not inherit from either of these two. Lastly, we learned about exceptions, which are errors that can arise when you run code, and ways to handle them.</h4><p>

  <h2>Week 11</h2>
  <h4>Key Takeaways:</h4> <p>This week we learned about OOP, object oriented programming, which is a way for us to organize and classify things into classes. This allows us to also reuse code to represent and perform operations on similar objects. Be sure to study up on the various definitions and terms related with OOP as there are a lot of new keywords such as the constructor (__init__) and the self keyword.</h4><p>

  <h2>Week 9</h2>
  <h4>Key Takeaways:</h4> <p>This week we learned about mutability, a property that describes data types that can be changed after their assignment. All data types are either mutable or immutable. Be sure to know how to mutate a mutable data type like a list or a dictionary. This means changing the original variable rather than making a copy of it with changes.</h4><p>

  <h2>Week 8</h2>
  <h4>Key Takeaways:</h4> <p>For this week's lab, we had a primer to our very first project, Maps! We learned about abstract data types which are used to represent anything in code form. Specifically, we used an example of an elephant ADT and looked at its selectors and constructor. We also learned about lambda functions, which are anonymous functions that can be written in a single line, as well as a new data type called dictionaries.</h4><p>

  <h2>Week 7</h2>
  <h4>Key Takeaways:</h4> <p>Just midterm review! Good luck :) please don't stress!</h4><p>
  <p><a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1joyl4iiBTNSHkoTDlH4H1sEW2lIxht6-W2gg-cdgmYU/edit?usp=sharing" role="button">Lab Slides</a></p>
  <h2>Week 6</h2>
  <h4>Key Takeaways:</h4> <p>This week, we learned about recursion, a problem solving technique that involves a function calling itself. Recursive functions can be transformed into iteration functions, and vice versa. We also learned about environment diagrams, which are a very useful tool to visualize code and how code is run by a computer. PythonTutor draws these for you!</h4><p>
  <p><a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1E7piTMgdXui-FaO3PlwWcoyCvvqn3Y4wtr-oc63UmFI/edit?usp=sharing" role="button">Lab Slides</a></p>
  <h2>Week 5</h2>
  <h4>Key Takeaways:</h4> <p>In this week's lab, we learned about higher order functions which are functions that take in a function as input and/or return a function as output. Some important examples of higher order functions are map, reduce, and filter! Please see the slides for detailed descriptions of the 3.</h4><p>
  <p><a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-HLhk_MQ2bOTmMMl30Gaj1zyMYc-tlVqnczO47i0bvE/edit?usp=sharing" role="button">Lab Slides</a></p>
  <h2>Week 4</h2>
  <h4>Key Takeaways:</h4> <p>In this week's lab, we focused on the new concepts of conditionals, lists, list comprehensions, and iteration. These will be fundamental building blocks for the more advance code we'll write later on! Be sure to see the lab slides, as they are more information-packed than usual.</h4><p>
  <p><a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1R5xZpYCKzG_79a4HBxeg9zIdsJvch2s-BwKsJQ9tnqE" role="button">Lab Slides</a></p>
  <h2>Week 3</h2>
  <h4>Key Takeaways:</h4> <p>This week, we learned about the different tools we can use to help debug our code. Reading the doctest given to you, analyzing and googling error messages, and using print statements are all very helpful in figuring out why your code refuses to work! We also learned about functions, the things that help make the world spin round (just kidding).</h4><p>
  	<p>Some things you should be thinking about are: 
  		<ul><li>the differences between global frame and local frame, and how functions tie into that</li>
  			<li>how call expressions are evaluated</li>
  			<li>how return and print are different</li>
  			<li>how PythonTutor can help debug/understand code</li></ul></p>

  <h2>Week 2</h2>
  <h4>Key Takeaways:</h4> <p>This week, we got to use the components we set up last week in order to do some coding and submit our first hw assignment!</p><h4>General Assignment Setup Process for the Semester:</h4><p>
  	<ol>
  		<li>First, download the files for the lab/hw.</li>
  		<li>In your Terminal/Git Bash, use cd (the "move into" command) to go to the folder that contains the lab or hw.</li>
  		<li>However you want, open up the file for the lab/hw in your text editor such as Sublime.</li>
  		<li>Whenever you want to run the code and test it out, type python filename.py in your Terminal/Git Bash.</li>
  	</ol>
  	Sometimes, we will have questions such as "What would Python Display?" that are answered in your Terminal/Git Bash. These do not have a coding part, so they won't be in your submission.</p>
  	<h4>Command Line vs. Interactive Mode</h4>
  	<p>A lot of students mix the two up, so here are the key differences.
  		<table class = "table table-condensed table-bordered">
  			<thead>
  				<tr>
  					<th>Command Line</th>
  					<th>Interactive Mode</th>
  				</tr>
  				<tbody>
  					<td>
  						<ul>
  							<li>$ means you are in it</li>
  							<li>is for typing commands, including cd directoryname and python filename.py</li>
  							<li>Type python or python3 to enter Interactive Mode</li>
  						</ul>
  					</td>
  					<td>
  						<ul>
  							<li>>>> means you are in it</li>
  							<li>is for typing Python code</li>
  							<li>Type quit() to go back to Command Line</li>
  						</ul>
  					</td>
  				</tbody>
  			</thead>
  		</table>
  	</p>

  <h2>Week 1</h2>
  <h4>Key Takeaways: </h4><p>In lab, we set up 3 components we'll need to code in this class. </p>
  	<ol>
  		<li>Terminal/Git Bash, which is used to access and organize folders and files</li>
  		<li>Text Editor, which we'll type our code in (definitely beats trying to code in Microsoft Word!)</li>
  		<li>Python, the very friendly and simple-to-read programming language we'll be using</li>
  </ol></p>
